# AdvancedR3:

TODO: Give a brief description of what your project is about

This project is a learning project for the advanced r course.

# Brief description of folder and file contents

TODO: As project evolves, add brief description of what is inside the
data, docs and R folders.

The following folders contain:

-   `data/`: Contains the cleaned lipidomics data
-   `docs/`: Contains the quarto script for learning during the course
-   `R/`: Contains the functions document, were all finished functions
    will be pasted and sourced from.

# Installing project R package dependencies

If dependencies have been managed by using
`usethis::use_package("packagename")` through the `DESCRIPTION` file,
installing dependencies is as easy as opening the `AdvancedR3.Rproj`
file and running this command in the console:

```         
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak()
```

You'll need to have remotes installed for this to work.
